# prompt: create and app that can take a picture scan it and decode the questions and give answers

# This code provides a conceptual outline for a basic image-based question answering application.
# It requires several external libraries and services to function fully.
# Please note that this is a simplified example and will require significant
# development and refinement to achieve a production-ready solution.

# Install necessary libraries
!pip install pytesseract opencv-python

# Import libraries
import cv2
import pytesseract
import numpy as np

# (Optional) Set Tesseract path if not in system PATH
# pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'/usr/local/bin/tesseract'
