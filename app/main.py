# objective: create and app that can take a picture scan it and decode the questions and give answers

# This code provides a conceptual outline for a basic image-based question answering application.
# It requires several external libraries and services to function fully.
# Please note that this is a simplified example and will require significant
# development and refinement to achieve a production-ready solution.

# Install necessary libraries
!pip install pytesseract opencv-python

# Import libraries
import cv2
import pytesseract
import numpy as np

# (Optional) Set Tesseract path if not in system PATH
# pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'/usr/local/bin/tesseract'

def capture_and_decode_image():
  """Captures an image from the webcam, scans it, and attempts to decode text from it.

  This function is a placeholder for a more robust image capture and processing pipeline.
  """
 # 1. Capture Image from Webcam (Requires OpenCV)
  camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 for default camera
  return_value, image = camera.read()
  cv2.imwrite('captured_image.jpg', image)
  del(camera)

  # 2. Image Preprocessing (Optional, for better OCR accuracy)
  # - Convert to grayscale
  # - Apply thresholding
  # - Remove noise 
  gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
  # ... More preprocessing steps here
  
  # 3. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract
  text = pytesseract.image_to_string(gray)

  # 4. Parse Text (Identify questions and potential answer choices)
  # This step needs to be customized based on your specific data format.
  # You might need to use NLP techniques and regular expressions to parse the text.
  questions = []
  answers = []

  # Example: Assume questions are marked with "Q:" and answers with "A:"
  lines = text.split('\n')
  for line in lines:
    if line.startswith('Q:'):
      questions.append(line[2:].strip())
    elif line.startswith('A:'):
      answers.append(line[2:].strip())

  return questions, answers

# Example usage
questions, answers = capture_and_decode_image()
print("Decoded Questions:")
for q in questions:
  print(q)
print("Decoded Answers:")
for a in answers:
a


# Next Steps:
# 1. Integrate a robust image processing pipeline (e.g., using OpenCV).
# 2. Improve OCR accuracy through preprocessing and potentially a language model.
# 3. Design a method for identifying and parsing questions and answer choices 
#    from the extracted text.
# 4. Connect to a question-answering system or model to provide answers.
# 5. Create a user interface (GUI or web app) for interacting with the app.
