# prompt: create and app that can take a picture scan it and decode the questions and give answers

# This code provides a conceptual outline for a basic image-based question answering application.
# It requires several external libraries and services to function fully.
# Please note that this is a simplified example and will require significant
# development and refinement to achieve a production-ready solution.

# Install necessary libraries
!pip install pytesseract opencv-python

# Import libraries
import cv2
import pytesseract
import numpy as np

# (Optional) Set Tesseract path if not in system PATH
# pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'/usr/local/bin/tesseract'

  This function is a placeholder for a more robust image capture and processing pipeline.
  """
 # 1. Capture Image from Webcam (Requires OpenCV)
  camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 for default camera
  return_value, image = camera.read()

  # 2. Image Preprocessing (Optional, for better OCR accuracy)
  # - Convert to grayscale
  # - Apply thresholding
  # - Remove noise 
  gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
  # ... More preprocessing steps here
