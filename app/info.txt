Enhance Image Processing: Fine-tune the preprocessing steps to improve OCR accuracy. Experiment with different thresholding methods, filters, and image enhancements.

Improve OCR Accuracy: Consider training a custom Tesseract model or using more advanced OCR libraries/models.

Parse Text: Use NLP techniques and regular expressions to accurately extract questions and answer choices. You might need to handle different formats and types of questions.

Question-Answering System: Implement logic to match questions with answers or use an AI model for answering questions.

User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface using a framework like Tkinter for a desktop app or Flask/Django for a web app.

assume that the images are uploaded from the phone. We can achieve this by designing a simple web interface using Flask where users can upload pictures taken by their phone.

Backend (Python) with Flask
We'll create a simple Flask web app that allows users to upload images. The app will then process these images and perform OCR.


sh
pip install flask opencv-python-headless pytesseract
