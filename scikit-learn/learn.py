   # Scikit-learn is a powerful machine learning library in Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, and it is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. Let's go through the basics to get you started.

# Installing Scikit-learn
#First, you need to install Scikit-learn if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:


# pip install scikit-learn

# Basic Concepts
# Datasets: Scikit-learn provides several built-in datasets, which can be accessed using the datasets module. You can also load your own datasets.

# Models: Scikit-learn provides a wide variety of machine learning algorithms, which can be used for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

#Training and Testing: You can train a model using a training dataset and evaluate it using a testing dataset.

\



















# Here's an example of how to use Scikit-learn to classify the Iris dataset using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

from sklearn import datasets

# 1 - Load the iris dataset

iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data  # Features
y = iris.target  # Target labels

# 2 - Split the dataset into training and testing sets:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 3 -  Train a model:

from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Create a Support Vector Classifier
model = SVC()

# Train the model using the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 4 - Make the prediction and evaluate  the model:

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Make predictions using the testing data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Key Modules in Scikit-learn
# Datasets: For loading and generating datasets.

# Model Selection: For splitting datasets, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.

# Preprocessing: For feature scaling, normalization, and other preprocessing tasks.

# Metrics: For evaluating model performance using various metrics.

# Feature Selection: For selecting important features.

# Example: Model Evaluation with Cross-Validation
# Cross-validation is a technique for assessing how a model generalizes to an independent dataset. Here's an example using cross-validation:

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Perform cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)  # 5-fold cross-validation
print(f"Cross-validation scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean cross-validation score: {scores.mean()}")
