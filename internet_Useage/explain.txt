Dependencies and Libraries:

psutil: Helps retrieve network usage statistics
sqlite3: Provides database functionality to store usage data
datetime: Manages time-related operations


Main Features:

Track internet usage per child
Set daily internet time limits
Generate usage reports
Store usage data in a SQLite database


Key Methods:

usage_log: Tracks individual usage sessions
daily_limits: Stores daily time limits for each child


set_daily_limit(): Allows setting internet time limits for each child
track_usage(): Monitors network usage for a specified duration

Captures bytes sent and received
Logs usage details to the database


check_daily_limit(): Verifies if a child has exceeded their daily internet time
generate_report(): Creates usage reports for a specified time period
Potential Improvements:

Website Tracking

Add functionality to log specific websites visited
Implement website blocking for restricted sites


Real-time Monitoring

Create a continuous monitoring mode
Add notifications when limits are approached


Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Develop a tkinter or PyQt interface for easier interaction
Visualize usage statistics with charts


Cross-Platform Compatibility

Enhance network tracking for different operating systems
Add more robust network detection methods



Security and Privacy Considerations:

Ensure data is stored securely
Implement user authentication
Provide options for children to view their own usage

Installation Requirements:
bashCopypip install psutil
Limitations:

Requires Python to be running to track usage
Basic network tracking (might not capture all network activities)
No built-in website filtering
